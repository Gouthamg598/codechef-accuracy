There are 100 questions in a paper. Each question carries +3 marks for correct answer, -1 marks for incorrect answer and 0 marks for unattempted question.
It is given that Chef received exactly  (0â‰¤Xâ‰¤100) marks. Determine the minimum number of problems Chef marked incorrect.

# program:
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x=int(input())
    q=x%3
    if q==0:
        print(0)
    else:
        p=3-q
        print(p)
        
        output:
